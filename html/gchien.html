			This visualization is a heatmap representing the average amount of money donated towards a
			specific category by each state. The user can select which category they would like to see
			the heatmap for, and the map colors, map title, and legend will update accordingly. The US map was generated through
			code borrowed from <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/a74faf20b492ad377312">http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/a74faf20b492ad377312</a>,
			which includes a javscript file uStates.js. Of course, this code was heavily modified to fit my needs (even a lot of
			uStates.js was rewritten). The colors and legend were generated using code adapted from <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084">
			http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084</a>. Hovering over each state will display a toolkit showing the state's number of users, number of
			donators, and the overall average amount of money donated.
