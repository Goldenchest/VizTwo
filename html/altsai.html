        <p> This visualization is a representation of the total amount of money donated within a one-hour range for any given day of the week. Amounts are divided into nine equal ranges, with lighter shades corresponding to lower amounts and darker shades to higher amounts. Mousing over a certain square will trigger a tooltip box that contains the total amount of money donated that hour of that day over the course of the month of data provided, as well as individual breakdowns per category. It also gives the square a linear gradient fill, with the coloring proportional to the amound donated per category. As funds donated tended to be relatively proportionate, however, the gradient coloring does not differ much from square to square.</p>
